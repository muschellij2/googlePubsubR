# Acking deadlines and long computations

The most basic of Pub/Sub workflows usually looks somehting like this

1. Pull data from a Pub/Sub subscription (having a `ack_deadline=10`)
2. Start running slow computations on the data (let's say they'll take 15 seconds)
3. When finished, ack the message.

Step 3 will obviously fail as the message to re-delivered while slow computations were running and has now 
a new `ackId`. The Python client library for Pub/Sub seems to automatically deal with this by extending 
the `ackDeadline` whenever needed.

## A possible approach
